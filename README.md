# GLinES
OpenGL in OpenGLES. That was my funny project to let games run on GLES 3.2 without extreme changes.

# Is this working?!
I wish to say YES! But for the moment the main problem is shaders (i think...). Not really sure, that project was abandoned 2 years ago because of IRL problems.

If you wanna continue working on it, you're free to use it in terms of MIT license!

I would like to see this working some time.
